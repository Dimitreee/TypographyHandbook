This repository contains the source code for _Typography Handbook_. It was built using a custom Gulp and Nunjucks powered static-site generator. This project was largely inspired by the works of [Adam Schwartz](adamschwartz.co/), [Zell Liew](http://zellwk.com/), and [Tim Brown](http://tbrown.org/).
