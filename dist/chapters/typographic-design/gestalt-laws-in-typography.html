<section class=chapter id=gestalt-laws-in-typography><h2>Gestalt Laws in Typography</h2><blockquote>Gestalt principles, or gestalt laws, are rules of the organization of perceptual scenes. When we look at the world, we usually perceive complex scenes composed of many groups of objects on some background, with the objects themselves consisting of parts, which may be composed of smaller parts, etc. <cite><a href=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles>Scholarpedia</a></cite></blockquote><p>The two most important Gestalt Laws to understand in typography are the Law of Proximity and the Law of Similarity.</p><h3 id=law-of-proximity>Law of Proximity</h3><p>To master the positioning of elements, it is crucial to understand the Gestalt Law of Proximity. The Law of Proximity states that humans perceive objects that are closer together as related objects. And vice versa, objects that are farther apart are perceived as different groups.</p><figure><img src=/assets/images/law-of-proximity.png><figcaption><a href=http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/cooking-with-typography-the-fundamentals/ >Image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In typographic design, "proximity" refers to the amount of whitespace created by line height, margin, and padding. There should be a distinctive and noticeable amount of <em>additional</em> whitespace between two different sections. Consider the following example:</p><figure><img src=/assets/images/proximity-example.png></figure><p>Note that the Law of Proximity does not mean that you should squeeze related content in a small container. No, free flowing whitespace is important too. Simply add noticeable, additional whitespace between two separate sections.</p><p>Visual hierarchy can broken down into 5 different parts:</p><ol><li><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> Size and weight are the two easiest way to create visual hierarchy. They easily indicate what is important, and readers' eyes naturally jump to them. By simply styling those two, a sense of importance is already created.</li><li><strong>Positioning: </strong>Positioning is another way to create visual hierarchy. Here, the title and author is above the rest of the text and centered, showing its importance.</li><li><strong>Typeface:</strong> Contrasting typefaces can create a distinction between different elements and achieve visual hierarchy.</li><li><strong>Color: </strong>Setting important text in a different color is a very easy way to create visual hierarchy. However, only do so sparingly as using color everywhere causes it to lose its distinction.</li></ol><h3 id=law-of-similarity>Law of Similarity</h3><p>The Gestalt Law of Similarity states that entities that look similar tend to be grouped together. For example, if all clickable texts are sky-blue, the audience will assume that all textual content that is sky-blue is clickable.</p><p>In typography, the law of similarity just means to keep your styles consistent on elements that serve the same function. Group of elements should also look similar to other groups that serve the same function, for example: the visual styles of one blog post should look similar to another blog post. On the other hand, elements with a <em>different</em> functions should not look similar to one another.</p><h4 class=further-readings>Further Readings:</h4><ul class=further-readings__list><li><a href=http://www.howdesign.com/resources-education/online-design-courses-education/gestalt-theory-typography-design-principles/ >Gestalt Theory in Typography & Design Principles</a></li><li><a href=http://www.market8.net/b2b-web-design-and-inbound-marketing-blog/gestalt-b2b-web-design-principles-%E2%80%93-part-3-proximity-uniform-connectedness-good-continuation>Proximity, Uniform Connectedness &amp; Good Continuation</a></li></ul></section>
