<p>Congratulations for making it to the end of this handbook. Typography on the web &mdash; a medium where the user can be on any device in any resolution  &mdash; is extremely difficult. When I first started designing websites years ago, I found it near impossible to find up-to-date information on best web typographic practices. There were many blog posts by experts with contradicting information, and existing books on the subject of web typography rarely go into details on technical implementation. <em>Typography Handbook</em> aims to solve this problem and provide almost everything that a beginner would need to know to create industry-standard typographic elements. I hope that this goal succeeded with you.</p>
