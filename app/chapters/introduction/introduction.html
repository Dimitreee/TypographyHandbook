<p>Typography is more than just what fonts you use. Typography is <em>everything</em> that has to do with how text looks – such as font size, line length, color, and even more subtle things like the whitespace around a text. Good typography sets the tone of your written message and helps to reinforce its meaning and context.</p>

<p>This is a handbook on best typographic practices through the lens of a web designer. It is meant to be short and concise – used as a reference rather than explanatory. For in-depth explanations and details, look at the links in the <em>Further Readings</em> of each section instead. </p>

<p>Lastly, this handbook is open source on <a href="https://github.com/kennethwang14/typography-handbook">GitHub</a> and will continuously be updated with the best practices. Enjoy.</p>
