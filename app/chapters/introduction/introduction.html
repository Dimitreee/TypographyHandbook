<p>Typography is more than just what fonts you use. Typography is <em>everything</em> that has to do with how text looks – such as font size, line length, color, and even more subtle things like the whitespace around a text. Good typography sets the tone of your written message and helps to reinforce its meaning and context. Here is an <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/why-does-typography-matter.html">example</a> used by Matthew Butterick in his web book <em>Practical Typography</em> that shows the impact of typography.</p>

<blockquote>Try this. Imagine you're a director of human resources. Below are two résumés that you’ve received for a job opening at your company. Being a busy person, you only have two seconds to decide who gets the last interview slot. Who do you pick?

I’m guessing you picked Trixie’s. But why? Maybe you’d say Trixie’s résumé looked more professional, neater, or better organized. All true, but those qualities don’t appear out of thin air. And if you look again, you’ll see that the credentials on the résumés are identical. The only difference is the typography.</blockquote>

<p>This is a handbook on best typographic practices through the lens of a web designer. It is meant to be short and concise – used as a reference rather than explanatory. For in-depth explanations and details, look at the links in the <em>Further Readings</em> of each section instead. </p>

<p>Lastly, this handbook is open source on <a href="https://github.com/kennethwang14/typography-handbook">GitHub</a> and will continuously be updated with the best practices. Enjoy.</p>
