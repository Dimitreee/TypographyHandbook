<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

<p>Visual hierarchy is the concept of organizing elements on a page in a way that establishes an order of importance, allowing readers to easily navigate the page and find relevant content. When done correctly, it should guide the reader's eye throughout different sections of the page. Visual hierarchy is very prevalent in typography, and forms the basis of typographic design theory.</p>

<p>Consider the following typographic design of <em>Alice's Adventures In Wonderland</em>, which clearly establishes a visual hierarchy: </p>

<p>Visual hierarchy can broken down into 5 different parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Size & Weight:</strong> Size and weight are the two easiest way to create visual hierarchy. They easily indicate what is important, and readers' eyes naturally jump to them. By simply styling those two, a sense of importance is already created.</li>
  <li><strong>Positioning: </strong> Positioning is another way to create visual hierarchy. Here, the title and author is above the rest of the text and centered, showing its importance.</li>
  <li><strong>Typeface:</strong> Contrasting typefaces can create a distinction between different elements and achieve visual hierarchy.</li>
  <li><strong>Color: </strong>Setting important text in a different color is a very easy way to create visual hierarchy. However, only do so sparingly as using color everywhere causes it to lose its distinction.</li>
</ol>
